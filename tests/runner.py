    # Frames Per Second
    # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    # (1) The human eye can process 10-12 still images per second,
    #     and the dynamic compensation function can also deceive us.
    # (2) At a frame rate of 12fps or lower, we can quickly distinguish between
    #     a pile of still images and not animations.
    # (3) Once the playback rate (frames per second) of the images reaches 16-24 fps,
    #     our brain will assume that these images are a continuously moving scene
    #     and will appear like the effect of a movie.
    # (4) At 24fps, there is a feeling of 'motion blur',
    #     while at 60fps, the image is the smoothest and cleanest.
